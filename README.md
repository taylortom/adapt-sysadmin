# adapt-sysadmin

This is an Adapt **authoring tool plugin** which acts as a container for arbitrary other plugins, grouped by their functionality as ‘system administration’-type features.

## Installation

1. Copy the `sysadmin` folder to `/frontend/src/plugins/` in your authoring tool folder. _**Failure to keep the root folder name `sysadmin` will stop child plugins working.**_
2. That’s it!

_**Note:** this plugin requires other child plugins to be installed to be useful._

## Usage

_**Note**: this feature is only available to users with a **Super Admin** account_.

The sysadmin page can be accessed via the item in the global menu.
